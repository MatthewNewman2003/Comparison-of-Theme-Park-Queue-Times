# Comparison-of-Theme-Park-Queue-Times
This repository contains code for a visualisation dashboard comparing theme park queue times. This was originally an assignment for the Data Visualisation module during my time at Cardiff University, but I made further edits to it following feedback.

The core dataset underpinning both dashboards is "Theme Park Queue Times.csv", a dataset containing various theme park queue times.

Both dashboards are embedded. The original dashboard is named "Original Dashboard.ipynb", while the improved dashboard following edits made to enhance user-friendliness is named "Improved_Dashboard.ipynb".

Exploratory data analysis performed prior to construction of the dashboards is also embedded, and is named "Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb".
